/**
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
 * string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
 * relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of
 * "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 * <p>
 * Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences
 * of source such that their concatenation equals target. If the task is
 * impossible, return -1.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are
 * subsequences of source "abc".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of
 * source string due to the character "d" in target string.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 1 <= source.length, target.length <= 1000
 * source and target consist of lowercase English letters.
 * <p>
